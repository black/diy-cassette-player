### Open Source Cassette Player

This project focuses on creating a cassette player to revive and play a collection of old songs stored on cassettes. The repository will include all essential resources: hardware designs, firmware, PCB layouts, and a detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) with component specifications.

The design is fully open-source hardware, allowing anyone to build their own cassette player or repair existing ones. The goal is to preserve the charm of cassette players while fostering a community of enthusiasts to customize, innovate, and keep this classic technology alive.
